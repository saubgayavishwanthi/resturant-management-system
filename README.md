# resturant-management-system
The C# Windows Application restaurant management system features admin and cashier logins. Admins add cashiers. Cashiers access the billing system, adding items to the bill with prices. They adjust quantities, view the total, and select payment methods. After payment, the system generates a bill. Admins manage employees and update the menu.
